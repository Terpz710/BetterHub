# Description
As the name suggest **BetterHub** is simply a better hub. We offer customizable features such as commands, messages, where to set the hub, timer and a easy to understand API!

This plugin also has a timer + blindness effect to make the proccess much more appealing than just sitting there waiting for a timer to finish, The blindness effect also brings a mysterious vibe, You may edit the timer within the 'config.yml'!

Unlike other hub plugins on the market, this one allows you to set the hub anywhere rather than relying on default world spawn.

# Requirement
This plugin requires a plugin called libasynql!

Make sure to drop both BetterHub and libasynql inside the 'plugins' folder!

Do **NOT** open bug report indicating this issue, I will close it without giving any response. Please make sure to read plugins descriptions!
